# Description
Objective of the Task
The primary goal is to develop a functional system capable of transcribing short audio clips into accurate text. Speech recognition is a rapidly growing field with applications in virtual assistants (like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri), transcription services, voice commands, automated captions, and accessibility tools for people with disabilities.
Understanding Speech Recognition
Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), is a process where spoken language is converted into machine-readable text. It involves several steps:
Audio Input: The system receives an audio signal, typically a .wav, .mp3, or .flac file.
Preprocessing: Noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction are performed.
Acoustic Modeling: Converts audio waveforms into phonetic units.
Language Modeling: Determines the probability of a sequence of words.
Decoding: Generates the most probable textual representation based on the input audio.
Tools and Libraries Suggested
The task encourages the use of:
SpeechRecognition Library: A simple yet powerful Python library that supports multiple speech recognition engines, including Google Speech API, Sphinx, and IBM.
Wav2Vec: A powerful deep learning model developed by Facebook AI (Meta) that uses self-supervised learning to achieve state-of-the-art results in speech recognition without relying heavily on labeled data.
Steps Involved in Completing the Task
Install Dependencies:
Libraries like speech_recognition, pyaudio (for microphone input), or frameworks like transformers from Hugging Face (for Wav2Vec models).
Setting Up Audio Input:
The system can take pre-recorded audio files or real-time microphone input.
Audio Processing:
Convert the audio into a format suitable for the recognition model.
Handle background noise and silence trimming.
Speech Recognition Implementation:
Using the SpeechRecognition library:
Create a recognizer instance.
Use recognize_google() or other engines to transcribe.
Using Wav2Vec:
Load a pre-trained model (like facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h).
Process raw audio input into features.
Predict the transcription using the model.
Output:
The transcribed text is displayed or saved into a file.
Error Handling:
Handle exceptions like unclear speech, background noise, or unsupported audio formats.
Deliverable
The final deliverable is a functional speech recognition system that can accurately transcribe short audio clips into text. This should be submitted as a Python script or Jupyter Notebook demonstrating:
Audio input.
Real-time or file-based transcription.
Displaying the resulting text.
Learning Outcome
By completing this task, interns will gain:
Hands-on experience with machine learning models related to speech.
Understanding of real-world challenges in audio processing.
Familiarity with AI tools and libraries.
Practical coding skills applicable to AI-driven projects.a
Submission Requirements
Code must be uploaded to a GitHub repository.
Proper commenting and documentation should be maintained for clarity.
Follow the guidelines provided in the WhatsApp group, including any video instructions.
Submit the task within the stipulated deadline.
Conclusion
This task bridges theoretical knowledge with practical AI applications in speech technology. It offers a foundational step toward more advanced projects in voice AI, including conversational AI, voice bots, and assistive technologies.
